    /// # Summary
    /// Creates an instance of a SelectSWAP QROM given the data it needs to store.
    /// Source: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00954.
    /// SelectSWAP qROMs consist of two parts: 
    /// 1) a "select" part in which the memory contents are specified and written 
    ///    out to auxiliary registers
    /// 2) a "SWAP" part, where the memory contents at the queried address are
    ///    transferred to the target register.
    /// A tradeoff can be made between the sizes of the two parts.
    /// # Input
    /// ## dataValues
    /// An array of memory cells where the address is an Int and the 
    /// data is a boolean array representing the user data.
    /// ## tradeoffParameter 
    /// An integer representing the number of address bits that will be "split off"
    /// to perform the mixed-polarity gates that detail the memory contents. This also
    /// affects the size of the auxiliary registers, making 2^(addressBits - tradeoffParameter). 
    /// copies. Valid tradeoff parameters are integers from 1 to addressBits - 1.
    ///   Example 1:
    ///   A memory has 4 address bits. Rather than doing mixed-polarity gates with 4 controls,
    ///   and holding a single copy of the target register, we can make a tradeoff. Setting
    ///   tradeoffParameter = 1 will "splinter off" 1 address bit from the rest, and make 
    ///   2^(4-1) = 8 copies of the auxiliary register. The select portion will be controlled on 
    ///   that first address bits, whereas the swap network is controlled on the remaining 3.
    ///   Example 2: (as shown in the paper)
    ///   Setting tradeoffParameter = 2 partitions the address space such 2^(4-2) = 4 copies
    ///   of the auxiliary register are created. The select portion uses the first 2 address bits 
    ///   as controls, and the swap network uses the remaining 2.
    /// (Note: the original paper uses a different definition of the tradeoffParameter in which
    ///  the number of auxiliary copies does not need to be a power of 2, however this complicates
    ///  the implementation. Here we consider only the more straightforward case.)
    /// # Output
    /// A `QROM` type.
